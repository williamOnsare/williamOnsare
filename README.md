## Hi there 👋

# William Onsare - Frontend Engineer (React · TypeScript)

I build pragmatic, maintainable frontend systems that ship value quickly — often in high-paced startup environments.  
5+ years delivering React-based UIs and internal tools used in production. I focus on reliability, performance, and clear handoffs with product and backend teams.

## Highlights
- Frontend stacks: **React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, SCSS**  
- Data & integrations: REST, GraphQL, third-party APIs  
- Recent projects: **ChatSasa (multichannel support platform)**, **WauguziApp**, **Mpesa Hash Decoder**.  
- Strong collaborator: cross-functional delivery with PMs, designers, and backend engineers.

## Featured repos
- [mpesa-hash-decoder](https://github.com/williamOnsare/mpesa-hash-decoder) — utility for decoding M-Pesa hashes.  
- [wauguzi-connect](https://github.com/williamOnsare/wauguzi-connect) — healthcare professional marketplace (frontend).  
- [tactical-admin](https://github.com/williamOnsare/tactical-admin) — admin dashboards and components.
